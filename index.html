The multi system compiling project
</br></h2>
<table width=800px><td>
<h3><br>This project is made for if compiling on one system it will compile the software on another system. To make this possible POSIX must be implemented on a windows compiler, then a common graphics and audio must be implemented on a windows compiler. Once a windows compiler has POSIX and a common graphics and audio, this will encourage coding developers to write code that is compatible on the majority of systems. If you want to support this project either create or help on issues, pull requests, or sponsor to <a href="https://coderrc.github.io">https://coderrc.github.io</a>. Once reached 10000 dollars per month this project would be worked on full time.</br></h3>
